##Simulating a container terminal using SimPy

Task
1. Simulate vessels arriving to the container terminal. The time between vessel arrivals follows an  exponential distribution with an average of 5 hour
     - Each vessel carries 150 containers that needs to be discharged (unloaded).

2. The vessels will need to berth at the terminal and there are only 2 available slots (berth_1 & berth_2). This means that if a vessel arrives and both berths are already occupied, the new vessel will be blocked and has to wait.
  
3. . Once the vessel berths, a quay crane (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_crane) will start lifting the containers from the vessel to terminal trucks.
    - There are 2 quay cranes and any quay crane can operate on any berth
    - The vessel will use 1 crane only
    - It takes the crane 3 minutes to move one container.
    - The crane must put the container on a truck. If no truck is available, the crane will have to wait until a truck is free before it can start its next move.
    - The crane can use any of the free trucks, it does not have to wait for the same truck to come back again. This means that if only one vessel is in berth, it will never be blocked by waiting for a truck. But if two vessels are in beth, the cranes will sometimes be blocked while waiting for a free truck.
  
4. The terminal has 3 trucks, transporting containers from the quay cranes to the yard blocks (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_tractor).
   - It takes the truck 6 minutes to drop off the container at the yard block and come back again

5. . Create a simple log (print statements does the job) for each event, e.g. vessel arriving, vessel berthing, quay crane moves a container, etc. The log should include the current time using SimPy Environment.now
(https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/simpy.core.html#simpy.core.Environment.now)

6.  When all containers have been lifted, the vessel leaves and the berth slot is free to be used by the next vessel.

7.   Run the simulation for some time using env.run(until=SIMULATION_TIME) where SIMULATION_TIME is a parameter the user can set.

8.   The simulation time in SimPy is unitless but in this exercise we can assume 1 tick = 1 minute
